Hi,

Not that I've played too often in the last two years, but i'm enthusiastic about video games and this project is for implementing the mechanisms necessary to realise the many (silly) ideas I have for games.

C appeals to my inner computer-geek the way Haskell does with my inner math-geek;
but I chose to write in FreePascal because I find it prettier than any other language I've encountered so far. Almost anyone who has understood the basic concepts of programming should be able to read and write fairly quickly.
Plus: The use of external libraries is limited, as most of them only supply c++-headers.

Why is this on code.google?
  * Students of computer science have a hard time socialising..
  * Maybe someone finds the code useful as an example for e.g. resources
  * Maybe someone finds the code to be a good example for a bad way of doing game-entity abstraction (He/She would better tell)
  * Maybe someone likes this so much, he/she wants to join/ hire me (who am I kidding?)

You will probably close this page and never visit again, but if you have an idea how to make this better, tell me; if not, I hope you find what you are looking for soon and wont have to read too many weird project-summaries in the process.

kind regards, yogo1212
